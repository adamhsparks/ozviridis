There's a heatwave in Australia at the moment. And this is the heatmap that is getting shown of Australia

```{r}

knitr::include_graphics("bom-heat-map.png")

```

Which shows that things are really hot.

But it's also pretty darn ugly. And I wanted to see if I could make it better, using awesome packages like `viridis` to colour the heat appropriately.

This is me, documenting my struggle with shapefiles and geospatial data. Eventually this will get written up into a blog post. But I figured that it would be nice to put on github like this, so that others can contribute, if they like.

First, we load the packages.

```{r pkg-load}

library(rgdal)
library(rgeos)
library(maptools)
library(ggplot2)
library(viridis)

```

Then we load the data, retrieved from [the bom site](http://www.bom.gov.au/jsp/awap/temp/index.jsp) - thanks to [Robbi Bishop Taylor](https://twitter.com/robbibt) for pointing out where to get it!

```{r pkg-read}
library(ozviridis)
data("oz_heat")

class(oz_heat)
# oz_heat <- readGDAL("2017-02-11-oz-heat.grid") # reads in the whole raster

```

# Quick methods for plotting

OK, so I can get a pretty basic plot with base `image`.

```{r}

image(oz_heat) # does a plot

```

But the colour scale isn't great.

With the `viridis` package I can make them look pretty.

```{r}

image(oz_heat,
      col = viridis(15,
                    option = "magma")
      )

image(oz_heat,
      col = viridis(15,
                    option = "plasma")
      )

image(oz_heat,
      col = viridis(15,
                    option = "viridis")
      )


```

There's also the default `spplot` from `sp`

```{r}

spplot(oz_heat,
       col = viridis(15,
                     option = "plasma"))

```

ROpenSciLabs has a `naturalearthdata` package that is fast and easy to use.

```{r}
# if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("ropenscilabs/rnaturalearth")

library("rnaturalearth")

sp::plot(ne_states(geounit = 'australia'))

```


So, the goal from here is to:

- Add the shapefile of Australia
- use `sf`
- Plot using ggplot
- add better legends etc to make it look more similar to the BoM image


```{r}

knitr::include_graphics("bom-heat-map.png")

```
