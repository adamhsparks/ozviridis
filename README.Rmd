# Notes on Jul. 20, 2020

As I've done some reading and been revisiting this idea, I realised that I had probably mapped the colours backwards.
I should have been using darker colours for the higher temperatures.
When I tried this using the 'inferno' palette there was little or no discernible colour separation at the highest temperatures and these details were lost in the map.
Switching to 'plasma' made these details much more clear and the map now displays the hottest temperatures as the darkest part of the map.

# Using the viridis ~~"inferno"~~ "plasma" colour pallete to map Australian temperatures on Feb. 11, 2017

This is a fork of [njtierney's](https://github.com/njtierney/) [ozviridis](https://github.com/njtierney/ozviridis) project. I'm building on what he's started, but making the map my way.

As Nicholas originally observed on 12-Feb-2017,

> "there's a heatwave in Australia at the moment. And this is the heatmap that is getting shown of Australia:

```{r out.width = "50%", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("bom-heat-map.png")
```

> Which shows that things are really hot.

Verymuchso.

> But it's also pretty darn ugly. 

Almost as ugly as the temperatures outside.

Nicholas wanted to see if he could use the viridis package to improve this map.
I completely agree; this should be doable.

## Setup

To do this you'll need a few packages from CRAN:

```{r pkg-load, eval=TRUE}
if(!require(pacman)) {
  install.packages("pacman")
}
pacman::p_load("raster",
               "ggplot2",
               "ggthemes",
               "viridis",
               "grid",
               "gridExtra",
               "rnaturalearth"
)
```

And one from SWISH, [awaptools](https://github.com/swish-climate-impact-assessment/awaptools):

```{r install_awaptools, eval = TRUE}
pacman::p_load_gh("swish-climate-impact-assessment/awaptools")
```

## Get the data to recreate our map

### BoM AWAP grids

Using awaptools get the mean maximum for February 11 2017.

```{r read_grid, eval=TRUE}
get_awap_data(start = "2017-02-11",
              end = "2017-02-11",
              measure_i = "maxave")

oz_heat <- raster("maxave_2017021120170211.grid")
```

```{r plot_bom_grid, eval=TRUE}
plot(oz_heat, col = heat.colors(n = length(unique(oz_heat))))
```

The plot works, the colours might not be any better than BoM though.
We'll get to that.

### Adding a shapefile of Australia

Now that the temperature data is in R, use the rnaturalearth package to get an outline of Australia.
We'll use this to map so we can see the states, but also to clean up the map a bit, see that previous figure? You can sorta pick Australia out, but it's not clearly defined.
We can use this to fix that.

```{r, australia}
oz_shape <- ne_states(geounit = "australia", returnclass = "sp")

plot(oz_shape)
```

### Clean up the heat map

Using raster package functions with the [Naturalearthdata](http://www.naturalearthdata.com) object, now mask out only landmasses and trim down the outline, removing islands that stretch the map and aren't of interest.
Note that we mask using the naturalearth object and crop using the heat map.

```{r mask_crop, eval=TRUE}
oz_heat <- mask(oz_heat, oz_shape)
oz_shape <- crop(oz_shape, oz_heat)
```

# Plot using ggplot2 and viridis

Now we're ready to plot this up using ggplot2, but first, we need to make the raster object into a format that ggplot2 can use.

```{r convert, eval = TRUE}
# Extract the data into a data.frame for ggplot2
oz_heat_df <- as.data.frame(raster::rasterToPoints(oz_heat))

# Make appropriate column headings
colnames(oz_heat_df) <- c("Longitude", "Latitude", "Temperature")
```

## Classify the heat map

BoM shows the map in 3&nbsp;˚C increments.
We can reclassify the raster so that it will display in the same way.

Using the `cut()` function, we'll set up our map in the same way.

```{r cut, eval=TRUE}
oz_heat_df$cuts <- as.factor(cut(
  oz_heat_df$Temperature,
  include.lowest = TRUE,
  breaks = seq(-6, 54, by = 3)
))
```

## The final product

Now, you can plot these together. Plot the new `data.frame`, `oz_heat` and layer a map of Australia on top of it.
The Australian map can be plotted directly from the spatial data, using the following method as described in the tidyverse here, https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/wiki/plotting-polygon-shapefiles:

```{r plot, eval=TRUE}
oz <- ggplot(data = na.omit(oz_heat_df),
             aes(y = Latitude, x = Longitude)) +
  geom_raster(aes(fill = cuts)) +
  scale_fill_viridis(option = "plasma",
                     discrete = TRUE,
                     direction = -1) +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE)) +
  geom_polygon(
    data = oz_shape,
    aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group),
    fill = NA,
    color = "black",
    size = 0.25
  ) +
  theme_map() +
  theme(
    legend.position = c(1, 0.15),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 8),
    legend.title = element_blank()
  ) +
  labs(title = "Maximum Temperature (˚C)",
       subtitle = "11th February, 2017",
       caption = "Data: Australia Bureau of Meteorology (AWAP) and Naturalearthdata") +
  coord_quickmap()

# Using the gridExtra and grid packages add a neatline to the map
grid.arrange(oz, ncol = 1)
grid.rect(
  width = 0.98,
  height = 0.98,
  gp = gpar(lwd = 0.25,
            col = "black",
            fill = NA)
)
```

That's much better and pretty close to what BoM originally created.
Using any of the ggplot `panel.background` or `panel.grid` result in the legend being outside the line, so not really a neatline for a map.
Using the gridExtra and grid packages fixes this.

## Cleanup on the way out

Remove the grid file that we downloaded earlier.
```{r clenaup, eval=TRUE}
unlink("maxave_2017021120170211.grid")
```
